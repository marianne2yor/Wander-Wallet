# Wander Wallet

Wander Wallet was my third project in the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. It is a travel budget management app that helps users plan, track, and manage their expenses while exploring the world. It’s designed to make financial tracking simple, so travelers can focus on the adventure instead of the stress of money management. There is still many rooom for imporvement and features. 

This project represents my growth as a developer. It’s functional, but I know there’s still a lot of room to polish, expand, and optimize.
